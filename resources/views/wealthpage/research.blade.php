					<p>Who is AmeriBanc? Are they a GOOD company? That is an important question.</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <p>Since our start in 2004, AmeriBanc has served over <strong>Tens of thousands of merchants</strong> and has worked with hundreds of employees, both Merchant Consultants and Call Center employees. We are committed to being as transparent as possible and giving access to all the information that a candidate needs to make an educated decision to become part of the AmeriBanc Recurring Wealth Program.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <div style="border-top:2px solid black; padding-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;">
                    <p style="margin-top:4px;"><img src="/assets/img/BBB-Accredited-Business-Logo.jpg" width="66" height="120" style="float:left; padding-right:10px" /><img src="/assets/img/BBB-Reliability.jpg" width="66" height="120" style="float:left; padding-right:10px" /><h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">CHECK THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU:</h3>AmeriBanc National is a member of the local Chicago Area BBB, but have also taken the steps to be a preferred member of the BBBOnlineReliability Program. To date, we have dealt with approximately 25 complaints and have resolved them ALL. We are VERY proud to have such a small number of complaints over the years, but you need to decide if 25 from tens of thousands is a good ratio?</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <p style="clear:both;">We currently hold an “A+” rating with the BBB and are listed with a  4 Star Rating on their site.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <p>AmeriBanc believes good customer service begins in the Sales and Marketing Departments, so it is mission-critical that every Merchant Consultant understand and convey our services accurately.</p>

Why would we do that? Simple... The Spirit of Transparency. AmeriBanc National has nothing to hide. We strive everyday to ensure customer service and employee satisfaction.

					</div>
                    <br>
                    
                    <p><strong>Google “AmeriBanc National” and the word “complaints”</strong> and lets find out all the BAD stuff that people have to say about AmeriBanc...</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <p>On the first page of results, we are greeted with 10 of the highest ranked search results for our search term.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <p>Five of the results are either our website, or related to our recruiting ads.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <p>Two of these results are from the BBB and Glassdoor.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <p>So now we have Three results regarding merchants receiving unwanted telemarketing calls to set appointments for our Merchant Consultants. The Call Center employees can select a button on their dialing screen that says “DNC Request” which places the merchant on a Suppression List, Supervisors and other Managers can also supress a number upon request. Additionally, we have published a page on our corporate site that any merchant can enter their phone number and it will automatically supress their number so we cannot dial it in the Call Center. We had an issue back in 2008 when our dialer and supression list failed and we made some repeated calls to the same locations. The dialer was fixed immediately and new controls to prevent this reoccurring were put in place. It has been working properly since that time.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <p>There is 1 result in particular from Jeremy Weiss, who started a blog about his 15-20 days with AmeriBanc.  His initial posts were fairly professional, but there were a number of posts from rookie agents voicing their complaints about appointments and desires for increased commissions. A few of the posts even have the appearance of being written by competitors. However; a good number of responses were <b>Merchant Consultants that had a very positive experience</b> and they took the time to post some very positive thoughts and experiences.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <p>One issue that was brought up in both a positive and negative light was the “quality” of the appointments being provided. While many candidates hear the phrase “sales appointment” and think “pre-sold”, AmeriBanc works very hard to explain that the Call Center finds merchants that are willing to listen to the presentation and often have to overcome objections to get the appointment. </p>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <p>Telemarketing is not an exact science, so we have a 3rd Party confirm each appointment and track the results of the appointment to ensure high quality.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <p>Approximately 2 results were from a site called the Rip Off Report, where we found that there were 2 complaints that seem to be well answered/rebuttled by happy employees/agents. Read them for yourself and decide. It's always tempting to go defend our reputation, but it is so rewarding when others do it for us.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <p><b>We want to be respectful about other people's opinions,</b> even if we disagree. While we work hard to hire the “perfect” candidates and train them thoroughly, inevitably, we come across some that just do not mesh well with our program, have a misconception that they just cannot get past, or feel that AmeriBanc should have done more to make them successful.</p>
