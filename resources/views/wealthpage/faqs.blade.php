A poor sales person can ruin a great appointment and a great Merchant Consultant can still sell a tough prospect. Appointments have 5 qualities to be considered an AmeriBanc Appointment.

Our Appointment Setters strive to present the benefits to merchants in a way that will transition well to a value-based presentation. We say that an appointment gets the door propped open and the chair pulled out, the Merchant Consultant will have to open the door wide enough to get in and sit down with the prospect.</p>

What occurs during the training period is that you, as a consultant, are going to be presenting to and learning the differences of hundreds of different business types. It's not as simple as Retail, Restaurant and Service. Successful Merchant Consultants NEED to know how to customize the AmeriBanc Services in all the different business scenarios. Our Training Graduates know how to not only cut a business' overall cost, but also, and more importantly, to increase their revenue to make a tremendous positive impact to their bottom line profits. This solution is different for every business type and successful Merchant Consultants are committed students of the industry.

We then look at all the resumes that we receive from that area and call on ones that we think would do well. After a few interviews, we offer the territory to one person, then we place a pin in a virtual map on a program we have in our planning department. From that point, we purchase 3,000 to 5,000 leads that would meet the criteria of someone we would call. We book your appointments from that list. Once we get a commitment from a new consultant, we get the ball rolling for that consultant and that territory. Everything we do is designed for the success of our Merchant Consultants. From purchasing leads to booking appointments, and an on-going training program that is equal to none!

This fact ultimately limits the consultant's effectiveness in the field. At AmeriBanc National, we're committed to our consultant's ongoing education and success and that is why we've created the most comprehensive training program in the industry. Your Regional Sales Manager will be providing both daily training and coaching as well as weekly and biweekly conference calls to keep you apprised of changes in the industry and services and of course, new services coming into the industry. Not only do we set you up for success, we keep you there!

We believe you should talk to them about the opportunity you've got in your market and that the services we're providing will allow your local merchants to take advantage of ones they could not have done before. Our Free Equipment Placement Program eliminates the number one obstacle for any merchant thinking about taking credit for the first time or perhaps switching processors, which is; how much is the equipment going to cost me? You should explain to them how in a short period of time with hard work, you could begin to build substantial recurring residual income, and explain what kind of security that could mean to your family for the future.

The fact is, in order to stay competative in this industry, we have to be able to provide competative rates. Every processor has to buy their rates from Visa/MC at the same price, so it's really just a matter of how many base points are added for their own profitability. We are all within the same ballpark when it comes to rates, so they quickly become less important compared to how we can help a merchant's business through the benefits of the additional services we can provide.

We also found we had to limit the overall commission plan to offset the costs of paying sales people that did not produce enough to cover their own salaries. We want a candidate to consider the possibility of failure before they simply assume they will be successful. Most sales people in the United States are not especially successful and that is why we tell every candidate that we are looking for the “top half of the class”. AmeriBanc is only looking to hire sales people that have experienced success in Sales in the past. This is not a good program for candidates that have no sales experience or have very little “closing” experience. Some work out, but most do not.
