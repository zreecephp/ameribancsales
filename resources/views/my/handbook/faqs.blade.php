			  <div style="border:3px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			 <br />
			<p><strong>Q. How do I get forms, applications, reference material and other materials?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> For all forms, applications and any other materials you require, you click on the "Forms" tab in the left menu bar which will drop down your document options. Here you can download and print any and all forms required.</p>
			  <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. How many applications should I have before I start?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> You should never leave your house in the morning with less than five (5) complete applications and two (2) Stand Alone Payment Jack Coversheets. Too many times you will encounter multiple locations or even salons that require multiple applications or multi-location deals.</p>

			<br />
			<p><strong>Q.</strong> How come I can only read the information for my first appointment on the e-mailed schedule and the others say ABN Appointment with a city and zip code?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> The purpose revolves around training and how to best maximize each selling opportunity and reduce your learning curve. As you will find, sales experience is key, but the difference of how to approach and sell a convenience store to a tattoo parlor to a funeral home to an auto repair shop is pretty dramatic in this industry. Ongoing, hip pocket training is the cornerstone of every successful organization. By creating the communication needed at and between each appointment allows the RSM and you to discuss how to approach the next, ideas for Gift Cards, etc. Never allow a selling or training opportunity to not be maximized.</p>

            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. What number should I contact my Regional Sales Support Manager?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> Always use <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">855-438-2261 (855-GET-ABN)</span></strong> which is the Sales Support Queue and set-up specifically for only the sales consultants. You will need to enter your assigned 5 digit rep code. This is the line the RSM&#8217;s will be answering during the day from 8:15 am to 6:00 pm CST. If you are outside those times and in a selling situation, you are also provided their cellular phone number for that purpose, but the sales queue is always the primary number of contact for everything.</p>
			  <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. When should I call my Regional Sales Support Manager?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> After your introduction call following the initial webinar, you should be calling him/her from inside each and every appointment so as to maximize the training at each and to assist in the sale. Also, you will be speaking during each day whenever you have any questions on the sales process or how to approach a merchant or the next appointment you are running.</p>
			  <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. What if I am going to be gone during a period of time or have an appointment?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> Contact your RSM by e-mail, informing them of when you will not be able to run AmeriBanc National appointments. You must give 48 hours notice whenever possible as the call center is setting appointments each day for the next day. This way no resources go wasted.</p>
			  <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. What if I have questions about payroll?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> All questions about payroll should be sent to your RSM and cc&#8217;ed to the VP of Sales via e-mail. This way, you will always have a tracking tool as well as they will. Payroll is important, so never rely on a verbal conversation, and because we are talking about your pay, this is NEVER something that we want lost in a verbal conversation. Always e-mail your requests for information.</p>
			  <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. How do I get Business Cards?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> You have a template sent to you from recruiting and you can purchase card stock from an office supply store and print your own out for yourself. If you do not have the capability, after your first sale, inform your RSM via email and they can order them for you.</p>
			  <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. What kind of equipment do I need to be a successful ABN Consultant?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> None is required, but purchasing a plain paper fax that you can carry in the trunk of your car for those occasions when a merchant does not have one can save a lot of time and money for you. A cellular phone with text capability is also highly recommended.</p>
			  <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. What is a Discount Rate?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A. </strong>The Discount Rate is a percentage of the electronic transaction each merchant pays to the processing bank. AmeriBanc&#8217;s discount rate for a swiped credit card and debit card (retail) transaction is 0.69% and 1.69% on Credit Cards. We also have a &#8220;Blended&#8221; rate of 1.29% for both credit and debit cards if the merchant needs. This would equal $1.29 on a $100 transaction, which is much lower than the industry standard of 1.6835%</p>
			  <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. What is a Transaction or Communication Fee?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> The Transaction/Communication fee is the cost of processing money through the worldwide Visa/MasterCard/Discover system. ABN&#8217;s Communication fee is 19 cents per transaction. Many times you see these referred to on other statements as WATS fees, Authorization fees, Per Item fees, and others, but all refer to the same cost.</p>
			  <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. What are Partially (Mid) Qualified and Non-Qualified Surcharges?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> These are added onto the qualified discount rate based on a specific type of card being taken. Many cards have Rewards attached to them, so Visa/MasterCard have increased fees for these transactions to be taken, and they are called Partially qualified, or also referred to as Mid-Qualified. These cards are built to incent the user to use it more often, and for increased amounts which is how the merchant benefits. Non-Qualified cards can be Government issued cards or Corporate level cards. The increased average ticket on these cards is obviously  based on the use.</p>
			  <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. What is an Assessment Fee?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> This is a fee charged by Visa/MasterCard on each transaction worldwide at .11%. Its purpose is to cover the risk of fraud and loss due to Credit Card fraud and identity fraud that they incur each year.</p>
			  <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. What is an Access Fee?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> This $0.0195 (just under two pennies) is the same purpose as the Assessment fee, but for the transaction/communication. These are required costs that are charged by all processors, but many do not disclose them upfront based on the fact that &#8216;they&#8217; are not charging them. AmeriBanc has always believed in full disclosure, bar none.</p>
			  <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. What is the $25 Monthly Minimum</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> The $25 Monthly Minimum is the minimum cost to the merchant for the processing of the transactions they take during any given month. Easily explained: as a processor, we have a hard cost for a processing account of $25 for any given merchant, before we realize any profit. If a merchant would process $2000 at 1.19%, their cost would be $23.80. AmeriBanc would add $1.20 to their bill because it was under the &#8216;Monthly Minimum&#8217;. It is not an additional $25, but a break even line for us that once a merchant is beyond, becomes irrelevant, which is true for 98% of all merchants.</p>
			  <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. What other fees are there?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> The merchant also pays a $15 Monthly Service fee and a $9.95 Debit Service fee.</p>
			  <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. What happens if the merchant does not swipe the card?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> The merchant will pay a higher rate for transactions that are not swiped because the risk is greater. There are several terms used for non-swiped transactions including key-punched, MOTO (Mail Order, Telephone Order) and internet accounts. The additional charge is normally the non-qualified surcharge added to the qualified rate. The exception to this is if the merchant primarily takes these types of transactions, by setting them up as a MOTO account, with a specific MOTO rate structure, 1.99% qualified, the merchant can avoid these &#8216;Card Not Present&#8217; surcharges and significantly reduce their costs.</p>
			  <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. How does the merchant pay the monthly discount fees and costs?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> All fees are automatically deducted once monthly by ACH (Automated Clearing House) deduction. The entire merchant bankcard industry use ACH for fees.</p>
			  <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. What is the basic difference between a credit card and a debit card?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> A debit card simply debits money out of a customer&#8217;s checking or savings account. The balance in the account does not necessarily affect the transaction. In most cases, even if the funds are not within the account for the transaction, it will be approved and the merchant&#8217;s funds are secure. Any overdraft cost is between the card holder and their bank. A credit card is a card issued by a bank with a given credit line, allowing the card holder to transact and purchase items they may not have immediate funds for and pay it off over time.</p>
			  <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. What does AmeriBanc National charge for American Express?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> American Express is a separate company that we have negotiated better rates with for our merchants. AmeriBanc National will simply program the merchant&#8217;s American Express merchant ID number into our equipment as a courtesy to the merchant, and they will have the lower rates and billing all on the 1 statement rather than 2. This means the merchant does not need separate equipment for any other processing needs.</p>
			  <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. What are EBT Cards?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A. </strong>EBT (Electronic Benefit Transfer) cards are government assistance cards (food stamp, Social Security benefit, state aid, etc) that are issued in lieu of checks. These are all excepted by a merchant using a pin based (entering a 4 digit pin number) transaction. The AmeriBanc National terminals can all be programmed to take these. If the merchant is currently taking them, you will be required to enter the 13 cents in the EBT transaction space and obtain the merchant&#8217;s 7 digit FNS number on the Special Request Addendum.</p>
			  <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. What if they add the Payment Jack device?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> Adding Payment Jack to a terminal placement or POS system only requires the Payment Jack Addendum and no changes to the Schedule of Fees. The addendum does show a simple $5.00 per month cost to add that service.</p>
			  <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. What if they want or need more than one Payment Jack device?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> Simply add on the information for the additional device(s) onto the Payment Jack addendum and there is a one time $19.95 purchase price for each device past the initial free one.</p>
			  <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. Can they process only with a Payment Jack?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> Yes, it is a &#8216;Stand Alone Payment Jack&#8217; solution. You would replace the pages of your application with the Stand Alone Payment Jack Coversheet and also use the Payment Jack Addendum. This is a $10.00 a month solution for the merchant without any monthly minimum. Remember that the Set Up fee is a one-time $89 check.</p>
			  <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. What is Check Conversion?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> Check conversion is similar to turning a check into a credit card. The merchant takes the customer&#8217;s check and swipes it through the Imager and then stamps it void for ACH (Automated Clearing House) on the check and hands it back to the customer. No longer requiring deposit slips or trips to the bank.</p>
			<p>Check conversion is regulated by NACHA (National Automated Clearing House Association).</p>
			<p>Before processing the check through the check imager, the merchant must:</p>
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> Verify and write the check writer&#8217;s Drivers License state and number on the face of the check.<br />
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> Verify the telephone number and write it on the check if it is not printed.<br />
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> Verify the address on the face of the check.<br />
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> The check is made out to the business name.<br />
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> The bearer of the check must be the writer of the check and the owner of the account.<br />
			<br />
			<p>If the above requirements are met, the check is guaranteed and deposited within 48 business hours, the same as a credit card.<br />
			<br />
              <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. What kind of checks cannot be processed?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> The following checks cannot be processed through the check imager:</p>
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> Third Party Checks<br />
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> Payroll Checks<br />
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> Temporary Checks<br />
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> Checks drawn on non-USA banks<br />
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> Business checks unless the signor of the check is the bearer of the check<br />
			<br />
             <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. Does Check Conversion and Guarantee work for checks received through the mail?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> No, checks accepted through this service are face to face transactions.</p>
			 <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
            <p><strong>Q. Are the costs for Checks on Demand in addition to the credit/debit service?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> Yes, it is a separate value service, though the cost of taking a check is the same premise as taking someone&#8217;s credit card. It incurs a rate (1.29%) and a transaction fee (.19) as does a credit card transaction.</p>
			 <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />>
            <p><strong>Q. Does the Monthly Minimum work the same as the credit card service?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> Yes, if the complete fees of the checks processed, minus the $10.00 service fee, does not add up to $25.00, the difference is added to the bill to come to a $25 charge.</p>
			 <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
            <p><strong>Q. Are there any other costs for Checks on Demand?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> The monthly service fee of $10.00 is the only other charge.</p>
			 <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
            <p><strong>Q. Do the Private Label Merchant Cards come with an amount on them?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> No, since they can be used as either gift cards, marketing cards, loyalty cards, reward cards, etc, they come with the merchants information on them and can be charged or loaded as needed right through the AmeriBanc National credit card terminal.</p>
			 <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
            <p><strong>Q. What fees are associated with the Private Label Merchant Card Program?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> The $19.95 per month flat cost covers all of the online reporting, card swipes (up to 200 per month), accepting the cards as payment and even allows the card holder to go online and check balances. It truly is an all inclusive program.</p>
			 <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
            <p><strong>Q. Can the merchant get their logo on the cards?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> Yes, once their initial order of 50 arrives, they will also be receiving the forms to fill out and attach any logo or artwork they would want on future orders.</p>
			 <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
            <p><strong>Q. What is the cost of reordering cards?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> The cost can vary based on the amount of the reorder and any personalized artwork or logo, but a ballpark figure on a reorder of 200 cards with envelopes, acrylic hangers, etc is about $45.00.</p>
			 <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. What is the Wireless terminal?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> This terminal allows a merchant to process in mobile applications where a receipt maybe required when completing the transaction. It does not require a telephone line or power which gives the merchant mobile freedom and the ability to get a qualified swiped rate where otherwise they would not.</p>
			 <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
            <p><strong>Q. Does the Wireless Terminal operate on a cellular phone?</strong></p>
			<p><strong></strong><strong>A. </strong>Very similar. It uses a GPRS system which is a cellular signal that usually gives a much broader reception. The signal is much less expensive than a cellular phone to operate. Its service cost is a flat $19.95 per month for unlimited usage. There is also a 10 cent wireless per transaction fee, and both of these are entered in the appropriate place on the Schedule of Fees.</p>
			 <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. How can I know if the Wireless Terminal has coverage in my area?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> You can call your RSM or simply go to the following website:</p>
			<a href="http://www.apriva.com/pos/partners/partner-program" target="_blank">Wireless Coverage Map</a><br />
			 <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
            <p><strong>Q. Do I need to get an additional voided check in addition to the $59 application fee?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A. </strong>No, simply fax the copy of the application fee in with the application, then you mail the check into AmeriBanc National.</p>
			 <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Q. What if the merchant is already in a lease on his/her existing equipment?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> The lease is a self standing liability that does not stand in the way of them changing processing, so it is truly not relevant to what we talk about. See the Objection Handling section for further discussion on handling this obstacle.</p>
			 <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
            <p><strong>Q. What about merchants who want more than one terminal?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> Most merchants do not need or require more than one terminal, but for those who do, we will provide a free terminal for every $75,000 of monthly credit card volume. If they are under that, but still request a second or third terminal you can rent them additional terminals using the rental forms found on the <a href="http://forms.ameribancsales.com" target="_blank">Forms Website</a>. Always have 2 of each in case this occurs.</p>
			 <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
            <p><strong>Q.What if the merchant is using a computer or POS to process?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> Your first challenge is to not look at it as anything different, but simply a virtual credit card terminal. Just present the services. Most POS systems are certified on the Global platform, which means that AmeriBanc National could assume the processing by using their current system. There is a list of compatible POS/Software in the references section of the <a href="http://forms.ameribancsales.com" target="_blank">Forms Site</a>, but always call your RSM for any questions regarding those systems before writing the merchant&#8217;s application.</p>
			 <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
            <p><strong>Q. What if the merchant has more than one location or store?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> Each location or separate DBA (Doing Business As) will require a separate application. Yes, this means separate commissions. It is no different than doing paperwork for two distinctly different merchants. You must remember that photo copying pages with initials or signatures is not authorized. If all businesses monies are deposited into one account, then the check can be duplicated.</p>
			 <div style="border:1px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>
			<br />
            <p><strong>Q. What if the merchant asks about supplies, does AmeriBanc National provide supplies free of charge?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.</strong> The only supplies necessary with modern equipment is standard 2 1/4 inch thermal paper. AmeriBanc National provides 3 rolls with every terminal deployed, and this paper is extremely inexpensive from most office supply stores. With the Merchant Advantage Program, the merchant is provided paper as well as discounts for their business and business supplies. Ensure that you look over the program and understand it, as it is free for the merchant for the first 90 days of their activation with AmeriBanc National.</p>
