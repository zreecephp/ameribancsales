			<p>First, you must realize why this is a good approach and something good to have in your Sales Presentation Book. It is always good to have as a closing tool for you as they make a quiet statement about you and your company by a happy merchant who made the decision that you&#8217;re asking the merchant in front of you to make. A person will decide to say &#8216;Yes&#8217; to you and your offering because they feel good about saying &#8216;Yes&#8217;. Third party influences such as testimonial letters are quite dynamic assets to you.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Also, sometimes you may get a request for a &#8216;reference&#8217;. Responding to this request in a positive tone saying, <em>&#8220;Bob, obviously in a financial industry, I cannot give out personal information of my clients, as I would be required to protect your private information by law. But because I always want my new client to feel comfortable, I have numerous testimonials and letters of reference from current customers </em>(turn to them in your presentation book)<em>. I look forward to coming back to your business after a few weeks or so and having you do one for me, also. Of course, I will help you as I know how busy you are. Now, did you want your statements sent here, or did you want to opt for the free online statement?&#8221;</em> Break eye contact, allowing him to look at the letters and start writing his information on the Free Terminal Placement form.</p>
			<br />
			<p>After 60 days or so, stop back and visit each merchant that signed up with you. Ask how our programs are helping them. Say, <em>&#8220;Bob, you could really help me in my business. Every day I call on merchants who don&#8217;t know the value a processor can and should bring to them as a business. What I would like you to do is to write a 2 or 3 paragraph letter informing other merchants how you have benefitted from the program we have set you up on and how I have been your consultant to work with. Is that OK with you?&#8221;</em> The merchant will most always say yes. These testimonial letters will help you close more sales. When you are in a closing situation, a powerful statement is <em>&#8220;do you really think all of these people I have done business with were wrong?&#8221;</em></p>
