			<p>One of the greatest assets in selling for AmeriBanc National is virtually every business category and every business owner is your prospect. We can help the smallest service business owner working out of their home or on the internet (carpet cleaning, pest control, plumbing, residential roofing, piano lessons, ect.) to the largest retail or wholesale businesses (new car dealerships, furniture stores, franchised restaurants, etc). Most banks will not accept in-home service or internet businesses because of perceived financial risk or lack of profit to the bank. AmeriBanc National accepts and welcomes almost all types of businesses and a commission is paid the same as any store front business. AmeriBanc National is constantly striving to provide merchants with the most cutting edge technologically advanced point of sale equipment at no cost. We even go beyond the counter by offering software solutions, internet gateway solutions, wireless terminal solutions and Payment Jack, which places electronic processing into their cell phone to help them push their business out the door and into the street, markets, fairs and shows. Not only does it provide the merchant with the ability to process without power or phone lines but it also reduces the processing cost by allowing them to swipe the cards for a more secure transaction.</p>
			<br />
			<p>AmeriBanc National&#8217;s ideal target market is small to medium-sized businesses. Although AmeriBanc is able to process for huge corporations, they do not fit well into the AmeriBanc model due to the extended sales cycle they normally require. They may be good side projects but sales people cannot survive on future commissions. We all live in a financial reality.</p>
			<br />
			<p>On the following pages you will learn about the types of businesses that fit well into the AmeriBanc model. The best way to find immediate success with AmeriBanc  is to follow the successful presentation and process we train you and guide you with. Common sense tells you that if there is already a proven model for success, why attempt to reinvent the wheel.</p>
