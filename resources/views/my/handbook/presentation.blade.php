			 <br />
			<p>Once you have put your AmeriBanc National Presentation Guide together in order, you have a great tool, but by personalizing it and making it an extension of your words, it becomes a dynamic and powerful guide for both you and the merchant.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Remember that this presentation is a reflection of you and your professionalism well before it is a window into AmeriBanc National. Does a white binder work? Yes it does, but for $10 or $15 more, does a leather (or leather-like) binder better speak to what you want to say about you? That is a decision you have to make, but never wait to see if you are going to be successful before you decide to be committed to success. It rarely works that way. I don&#8217;t know of anyone who ever achieved success without being committed to it first.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Bringing the merchant into the presentation is crucial to any sale, and if you are pointing at pretty pictures and reading upside down, you may not be achieving what you set out to do. Think of it this way; when you were a child, there were some people who would read a book to you, and others that made a story come alive. An important part of making a story come alive is the ability to make it seem real to your audience, bring them into it and have it revolve around them. Since a merchant will never buy for your reasons or your beliefs, only theirs, making it come alive and real for them is the best way to achieve this.</p>
			<br />
			<p>First thing is to humanize it. When you open the cover, they should see you as a person. When you walked into their door, they saw a &#8216;salesperson&#8217;, so by reminding them that you are a local business-person, just like them, it takes down the defenses and will establish commonality. Let&#8217;s explain:</p>
			<br />
			<p>When the Presentation Guide is first opened, if all they see is printed pages and sales terminology, you are a salesperson. If the first thing that they see is a picture of your family, your dog, your son in his football uniform, your daughter in her cap and gown or tutu, or you holding the bass you caught last summer, they see you and maybe even themselves. You must do this on one page and NOT make this a scrapbook rather than a sales book. This alone can be a game changer. The challenge, for us proud parents, grandparents or even fishermen is to not use this time to talk about you. This is the time to ask about them and how they got started. Visually they will connect to the pictures and relax.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Turning the page, the next thing they should see is the Better Business Bureau A+ rating page and the Low Rate and Fee Warranty. You have lowered their defenses, now it is time to lower their anxiety. Use something like:</p>
			<br />
			<p>&#8220;Bob, most business owners like yourself, find that the main concerns they have when eve considering any business improvements, are service, cost and commitments (pause and make eye contact). Before I even start I want you to know that we are a registered member of the Better Business Bureau and carry an A+ rating in all 50 states. We do because we do what we say and we take care of our merchant partners. As for cost, we are so confident in the fact that we will lower your costs each and every month that we actually issue a Low Rate and Warranty to every new customer. We believe in earning your business each and every day that we have it, so if at any time we do not do what we say, we allow you to leave us without penalty, which I am sure is the same way you have to earn and keep your customers, too.&#8221; This is the perfect time to turn the page and transition into the 3 Qualifying Questions as you have opened their mind and lowered their defenses.</p>
			<br />
			<p><strong>TRANSITION INTO THE B.U.I.L.D.:</strong></p>
			<br />
			<ul>
			<p><strong>1.</strong> &#8220;Bob, you&#8217;ve been in business for quite awhile, have  your goals changed at all, especially with this economy?&#8221; be quiet and take notes on the top of the Value for Merchant worksheet.</p>
			<br />
			<p><strong>2.</strong> &#8220;When you look at Growth, are you focused more on expansion or simply growing your bottom line and revenues?&#8221; again, making sure you are taking good notes.</p>
			<br />
			<p><strong>3.</strong> &#8220;To approach any growth, most look to marketing or advertising to get more customers or more money in the front door. Do you have a advertising budget?&#8221; like any good lawyer, you can be assure you know the answer to the question before you even asked it. After they answer, a good retort is &#8220;I understand, most tell me they have an advertising <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">expense</span></em> between Yellow Pages, ads, etc, they are spending money without any idea of what true return they get from it, if any.</p>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<p>Now you have reached to where your Supplement to the Key Card will guide you into a presentation of the service segments. This is not something you want to leave to chance. These next words, statements and questions you pose to the merchant will determine the outcome more than the service segments themselves, so study and practice as if your livelihood depended on it, because it does.</p>
			<br />
			<p>In the last pages of your Guide, you should be able to start filling with Gift Cards from current merchants, business cards and testimonial letters (read the section to help get them) to where you can always have a place to go when you hit a speed bump. Of course you will have your RSSM and us as a constant ongoing support system, but remember that creating your own is the end game. There is an old saying in the Army: &#8220;Train as if you are in battle and execute in battle as you have trained.&#8221; Success is never accidental.</p>		</div>
