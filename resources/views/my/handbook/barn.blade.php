			 <div style="border:3px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
            </div>			 
			 <br>
			<p>With a combined industry experience of over 50 years, it is our opinion that if you honestly and surely helped the merchant within the realm of cost savings, revenue increase, and eliminating liabilities they were experiencing, you have earned the right to ask for referrals. There are many ways to ask for referrals, but this will be the first step for you to begin to <strong>B.</strong>uild <strong>A. R.</strong>eferral <strong>N.</strong>etwork (<strong>B.A.R.N</strong>). There are a number of ways you can ask for referrals, and we will cover a few for you. We encourage you to ask for referrals from not only the merchants you sell, but also from those you do not sell.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>One way to ask is simply to say <em>&#8220;Bob, our program is going to allow you to benefit in hundreds of dollars a month, and maybe even thousands. Do you know anyone else you can think of who would benefit from these programs also?&#8221;</em> Move your pen to your paper and break eye contact, waiting for the response. 80% of the time he/she will give you at least one name or more, so always ask.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Occasionally you will have merchants who want the equipment up and running and processing with us before they offer referrals. When this happens, go to the store and ensure you have a case or two of 2 1/4 thermal terminal paper. For less than $1.00, you can drop by the merchant, place 2 rolls on the counter for him and ask how everything is going. Knowing the positive reaction, you can say, <em>&#8220;Here is how you can thank me. Give me 3 or 4 friends or people you do business with that I can also help get involved in our program.&#8221;</em></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><h4 span style="text-decoration: underline;color:rgb(0,90,170)"><strong>Using the Private Label Gift/Loyalty Program to Build Your B.A.R.N.</h4></strong></span></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>If you have set up your merchants with the Private Label Merchant Card Program, you have not only helped them grow their business, but you have set yourself up to use their program to help build yours. By simply returning to their business after they have trained with the tech department  (5-10 days after the sale), you stop by to ask if they have the program up and running.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Now you can say, <em>&#8220;Bob, I would love to help send some people into your business and become one of your most affective marketing tools. What I am going to do is take about 5 of your cards, put a $5 value on each. When I speak to other business owners this week, I will ask if they could use a $5 off card for one of the best restaurants/auto repair shops/tanning salons/etc in the area </em>(tailor it to the type of business they are)<em>. I am going to put my initials on the back of the cards, so when they come in, you will know who sent them.&#8221;</em></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>You can also add into this thought, <em>&#8220;Bob, would you be averse to having your business being advertised in other local businesses? If not, I have a few merchants who would love to advertise in yours. If I can facilitate this, we can create a great local consortium, keeping local dollars in local businesses and also maximizing foot traffic. I am sure you could always use a few more customers coming into your store to spend money, right?&#8221;</em> Now you have started to set up what can become a point of referral base where you start receiving referrals to the point that you not only do not need the AmeriBanc National appointments, you simply do not have the time to run them. You are now set to go out onto the Certified Independent Consultant Program. That is what B.A.R.N. is all about. To allow you to take that next step into the Certified Independent Program.</p>
