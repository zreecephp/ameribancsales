			<p><strong>1.</strong> Once accepted into our program, all new consultants will be attending and graduating AmeriBanc University, our web-based Pre-Training and continuing education institution.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>2. </strong>Attending and completing our Webinar Training with us guiding you through a level and confidence in the Company, the Product and the Presentation.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>3. </strong>By having serious hunger and passion to, have, or do the extraordinary for themselves and their family.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>4.</strong> To be willing to focus on what needs to be accomplished every day and do what it takes to persevere regardless of the current circumstances.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>5.</strong> By having written plans and goals. Only 2% of all Americans have written goals and those people are in the top 10% of annual earnings. Success does not happen by chance, but is a well thought out and focused effort. MAP out goals daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>6.</strong> By totally and completely focusing on the Daily Ingredient goal of:</p>
			<ul>
			<p><i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> Running 2-5 AmeriBanc set and confirmed appointments and following the presentation steps at each.</p>
			<p><i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> Getting in front of 15 to 25 businesses that fit into the small to medium-sized business profile.</p>
			<p><i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> Personally speaking to 4-6 business owners each day about the advantages of working with AmeriBanc National.</p>
			<p><i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> Collecting 15-20 business cards from business owners each day and completing the AmeriBanc Lead List for them to be called and set for you.</p>
			<p><i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> Giving 5 quality presentations, explaining the benefits of our program and asking for a Yes or No decision that day. The goal of 5 should be achieved through the set appointments or personally prospected presentations.</p>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<p>Success with AmeriBanc National is achieved more by meeting your action goals than sales quotas. If you take Massive Action Plans, the sales will find you. Let us guide you step by step through this process to move into the Certified Independent Agent Program.</p>

			<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s too much to hope that all of us will become great. Perhaps it&#8217;s not to be expected that each person can grow and progress to the point that he or she might become the best they can be. Maybe it&#8217;s too much to expect people to make the most of the talents they have, the opportunities they find, and the relationships they form.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s too much to hope that we seek greatness, and find it. But maybe it&#8217;s not too much to hope. Each of us has the ability to become great &#8212; and if each achieves greatness, it takes nothing from those around us. Each of us can &#8212; to borrow a phrase from the Army &#8212; be all that we can be. Each of us can grow and endure and learn and progress. Each of us can be better than we&#8217;ve ever been in the past.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Each of us can become great. What&#8217;s more, each of us should become great. Why? Because each of us needs to be great. Deep within us, we all have an innate need to be better, faster and smarter. Each of us has within him or herself, a need to be great. So why not address that need? Greatness is a matter of continuous progression. Each day, we become better, each minute, we try not to slide back. Each of us commits to be better, stronger, and happier. Each of us makes a conscious choice to become great.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Each of us has a path that will take us to greatness, but it&#8217;s left up to each of us to choose the path he or she will take. Each of us can start on that path, but few of us will actually do so. Each of us knows (or can know) the path that is right for us, but only a select number of us will choose to take that path.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Greatness, then is a matter of choosing the right path, taking that path, and constantly progressing until we become great. And here&#8217;s the real trick to this quest. Greatness is rarely a matter of a big leap &#8212; it&#8217;s mostly a set of little steps, each one a bit better than the one before. Each step brings us closer or farther away from greatness. Each motion helps us or hinders us. Each choice makes us better or makes us worse.</p>
			<br />
			<p>The pursuit of greatness is usually an endurance race, not a 100 yard dash, but the endurance race is usually run at a pace that we can handle. Most of the time, people dismiss the quest for greatness as something that they cannot undertake. They dismiss the quest because they feel that in order to achieve greatness, one must already be great. But greatness is something that can be attained by any person. Some will find the quest easier, some will find it more difficult &#8212; but each can achieve greatness in their own way, at their own pace, in their own time. Some will find it faster, some will be slower &#8212; but all can achieve.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Choose the quest; establish and follow your path to greatness.</p>
