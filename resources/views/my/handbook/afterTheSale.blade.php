			    <div style="border:3px solid rgb(0,82,165);">
			</div>
			 <br />
			<p><strong>1.</strong> As you do from every appointment, your first action should be to call in to your Regional Sales Support Manager to inform him that you have gotten the sale and would like him to go over the application with you before you leave the merchant&#8217;s location. Leaving the merchant with the original application is part of the AmeriBanc National difference, giving them a feeling of security.</p>
			<br />
			<p><strong>2.</strong> The pages you will be faxing are:</p>
			<ul>
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> Merchant Credit Card Processing Agreement Pages 1-2 of 2<br>
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> A copy of the $59 Application Fee Check or voided check if being ACHed<br>
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> Checks on Demand Application (if applicable)<br>
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> Gift Cards on Demand Application (if applicable)<br>
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> Merchant Invoice and Receipt<br>
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> Any other supporting documents filled out for the merchant<br>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<p><strong>3.</strong> Once you have faxed in the pertinent pages of the application from the merchant&#8217;s location and all of the required information is correct, your Regional Sales Support Manager will want to Cement the Sale, welcome them aboard and thank them for their business.</p>
			<br />
			<p><strong>4.</strong> This is also a good time to ask for referrals. They are excited about their decision and asking them for 2 or 3 quality introductions that may be interested in benefiting from these programs can reap great rewards.</p>
