			<p><em>&#8220;We are able to bring relevant and powerful training to our reps every day, giving them the edge that they need to increase their merchant portfolios. This kind of access to this caliber of training keeps AmeriBanc National Consultants at the forefront of the Electronic Payment Industry. We push videos, blogs, industry news and relevant documentation out to them &#8211; it makes success for them that much easier! I predict that competitors will follow our lead on this just like they have with Free Equipment Placement Programs and our Value-Added Presentation Style.&#8221;</em></p>
			<br />
			<p>It was an exciting day when the core of our vision was realized and the resources for new and experienced Sales Consultants had come together. Being able to not just be a run of the mill ISO in the Merchant Processing Industry, but seeing ourselves as more of a &#8216;Teaching and Training Organization&#8217;. With a focus on assisting and guiding sales people into an industry that has tremendous potential, pairing this career launching pad with the tools, both online and one-on-one, to allow our outside sales staff to create and become their own ISO.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Most opportunities are missed by most because it looks like a lot of work. The challenge for most in the merchant processing industry was learning it. The opportunity was great, but the learning curve was almost insurmountable for anyone trying to get in from the ground level. This is where AmeriBanc National has bridged the gap. By using and following the vast sales support and resources that have been created, the opportunity bridge has been built for those who want to cross. The opportunity is still work, but we have decreased the learning curve and increased the income received during learning.</p>
