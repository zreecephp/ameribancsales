			<p>Welcome to one of the most successful companies in America. AmeriBanc National has  been helping build their business and reduce the cost of doing so nationwide for over 8 years, and is one of the fastest growing companies in the Merchant Processing Industry. We take pride in knowing that, with integrity, we have helped tens of thousands of small to medium sized business owners grow their business and save millions of dollars, and we are determined to be the best and most innovative processing company in America.</p>
			
			<p>AmeriBanc National offers experienced sales professionals a program to learn how to build a Recurring Residual Wealth Portfolio.</p>
			<br />
			<p><h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;color:rgb(0,90,170)"><strong>What is a Recurring Residual Wealth Portfolio?</h4></strong></span></p>
			<p>Good Question. AmeriBanc National is a registered ISO/MSRP for Visa and MasterCard. We provide Electronic Payment Processing Services (Merchant Services) to Level 4 Merchants across the United States. The average Merchant Services Account can provide a Merchant Consultant with 50% to 70% of the net profits from each account that is one of the merchant customers signed up in their &#8220;portfolio&#8221;. The nature of these profits is small but RECURRING. AmeriBanc National believes that it is important to maintain competitive pricing for all of our customers so the path to a large Recurring Residual is to collect as many customers as possible as quickly as possible.</p>
			<br />
			<p><h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;color:rgb(0,90,170)"><strong>FIRST THING FIRST:</h4></strong></span></p>
			<p>Preparation and Training is the lynch pin to any sustainable success. With hundreds of different kinds and type of merchants, AmeriBanc spends tons of time preparing, training and assisting our Merchant Consultants to learn how to present a Consultative Solution to each different merchant type. This is no small feat, but is critical to a Merchant Consultant being prepared so that once they complete the Merchant Consultant Training Program; they are more than ready to begin the learning process by doing most of the prospecting for our agents, offering weekly training and experienced assistance with each and every sales call.</p>
			<br />
			<p><h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;color:rgb(0,90,170)"><strong>What is the Catch?</h4></strong></span></p>
			<p>It&#8217;s hard work. Learning to write up 20-40 new merchant accounts per month is 5-7 times as much as a typical agent in our industry. Our Merchant Consultants have a level of intelligence matched with communication skills that enable them to communicate the benefits of our service package in terms of new dollars and customers that the Merchant can gain with our program. With the appointments we provide and the Free Terminal Placement Program we offer, Merchant Consultants can present the benefits clearly without much of a financial investment from the merchant which makes the decision much more clear and simple for prospective customers.</p>
			
			<p>The average commissioned sales person spends 75% of their time prospecting and only 25 % of their time actually presenting to a customer. At AmeriBanc, our Merchant Consultants spend 50% to 75% of their time actually engaging new clients.</p>
			<br />
			<p><h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;color:rgb(0,90,170)"><strong>What is the Client Market?</h4></strong></span></p>
			<p>Since the turn of the century, national statistics have shown that more than one of every two dollars spent in the retail market is spent with credit or debit cards. IN the past several years, the percentage of those transactions being done with the debit/check card has exceeded 60%. AmeriBanc National is one of a very few processing companies that separates these types of cards, reducing the cost of them automatically for the merchant. By separating the debit/check cards from the credit card transactions, with AmeriBanc National, the merchant gets the advantage of reducing their cost without having to change the way they are doing business making for a comfortable improvement to their current processing procedure.</p>
			
			<p>Over ninety percent of retail merchants accept electronic payments in the form of credit and debit/check cards. Many of the business owners applied for Visa/MasterCard processing services with their local bank the same day they opened their business checking account. During the past 30 years, banks have only felt it necessary to compete with other bank&#8217;s processing services and rates which guides those business owners into basic processing and rates that average between 2% to 4% of each dollar processed based on certain criteria. The banks base the rates and fees they assign merchants on the following criteria:</p>
			
			<ul>
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> The type of business<br>
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> The business owner&#8217;s credit rating<br>
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> The average dollar amount of each sale<br>
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i> The proposed average volume of sales per month<br>
			</ul>
			<p>AmeriBanc National approves 99% of the merchants who apply for electronic payment privileges, and does so without prejudicing against any of these criteria. We believe in leveling the playing field for all merchants to achieve a level of success. We are able to show most businesses several hundreds of dollars of monthly value to their business as well as cutting the average merchant&#8217;s cost by $600 to $6000 per year in processing fees depending on their monthly Visa/MasterCard volume.</p>			</div>
