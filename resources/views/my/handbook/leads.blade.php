			<p>When you approach the subject of Prospecting, cold calling, area canvassing, etc, most do realize that this is an important part of every successful sales plan. Unfortunately, the approach most take is a path to that is not the most fruitful. When approaching this subject, you have to understand that your goal should NOT be a cold meet in the hopes to present and sell. That is the downfall of most sales people. If you simply focus on the introduction, you will be amazed at the different and increased result you can have.</p>
			<br />
			<p><strong>1.</strong> Walk into a business (without ANY sales material in your hands), taking notice if they are displaying any V/MC stickers, signs indicating the either take or DO NOT ACCEPT checks, or any other pertinent things that may fall into your benefit.</p>
			<br />
			<p><strong>2.</strong> Say to the person behind the counter:</p>
			<p><em>Hi, I&#8217;m __________ and in business locally as you are. I was in the area doing a free placement and noticed you had (did not have) electronic payment stickers in your front window. I don&#8217;t have any time right now, but has anyone every discussed the new amendments and acts that could directly positively affect your business? (Wait for the yes or no, but push past any conversation) I would love to get a business card and see if we could set a time later this week when I have some time to sit down and go over the benefit for your business (and simply hold out your hand). </em></p>
			<p>This is a good time to verify you are talking to the business owner, also.</p>
			<br />
			<p><strong>3.</strong> 80% of the time you will get a business card and we will discuss filling out the information on your AmeriBanc Lead List. 10% of the time you will get a no, which is sales, but the remaining 10% of the time, they may direct you into a conversation about wanting to change. Resist the urge to present without your Presentation materials, simply say &#8211; <em>&#8220;Let me go call my assistant and push back my next appointment so I can actually address your concerns and help you out.</em>&#8221; Go back to your car, get your materials and if you may be late for your next ABN appointment, call your RSSM to make sure he knows what you are doing and can inform the next appointment that you may be late.</p>
			<br />
			<p><strong>4.</strong> Know that the focus is to get the business card to supplement your ABN appointments and tighten and reduce your selling radius.</p>
			<br />
			<p><strong>5.</strong> Here are some other thoughts or comments that may help you while you are within the approach mode of prospecting:</p>
			<br />
			<ul>
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i><em> What is your current processing company doing to drive new customers into your business and help grow your bottom line</em>
			<br />
			<br />
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i><em> AmeriBanc National is an A+ rated Better Business Bureau registered company and one of the largest processing companies in the United States. We do focus on growing your business, with no term contract, free equipment and guaranteed lower cost structure to cut your end of month costs. It is important for you to know that the money we return to you is nothing more than excess charges and fees you are now paying to your current processing company.</em>
			<br />
			<br />
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i><em> I did not stop by to sell you anything. We offer free service comparison, free equipment, free marketing and advertising, no term contract and focus on driving new customers and business through your front door. We help thousands of merchants like yourself realize a better bottom line and reduced cost, time losses and eliminated risk. If we can&#8217;t make a positive difference in your business we say thank you for the opportunity you gave us.</em></li>
			<br />
			<br />
			<i class="icons-home icon-ok" style="color:rgb(172,23,28)"></i><em> A simple cost comparison takes a few minutes, but while I have the cost staff go over that to get us a true number, I would love to discuss your business  and to see if we could help you cut cost, eliminate liabilities and show some real time saving, also. If it is a good fit, great. If not, we can always shake hands and part as friends.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<p><strong>6.</strong> Make mental notes to write down for your appointment whether they are leasing, renting, own equipment. Are they accepting checks, using Gift or Loyalty programs, whether they are using a paper or plastic type? Any specific concerns they have so you can approach those directly within your presentation.</p>
			<br />
			<p><strong>7.</strong> At the end of each day, fax or e-mail your AmeriBanc Leads List to your Regional Sales Support Manager. Make sure you verify it was received. Make sure to annotate on each as to whether you need to call center to call to set the appointment for you, or whether you have solidified an appointment and when it is to make sure the Call Center is not setting you during that time slot for that day.</p>
