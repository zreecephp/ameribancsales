			<p>Effective November 1st, 2014 AmeriBanc National enhanced our Compensation Program that will pay you on each approved account. We still have our Weekly Bonus as well as our Enhanced Monthly Bonus and we will continue to pay you on Wireless Accounts. We still will pay you &#8220;RESIDUALS&#8221; on your accounts you have signed up and we will PAY YOU MORE $$$ for your self generated (off board) approvals.</p>
			<p><strong>(This new compensation plan replaces any and all other compensation plans in place)</strong></p>
			<br />
			<p><h4 style="text-decoration: underline;color:rgb(0,90,170)"><strong>Here&#8217;s How It Works:</h4></strong></p>
			<p><strong style="text-decoration: underline;"> STILL NO LIMITS:</strong></p>
			<p>First, there still is no limit to your income in any week or month!!! You will earn a commission based on the weekly <strong>APPROVALS</strong>. Bonuses will be based on weekly and monthly totals of approved installations.</p>
			<br />
			
			<p><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">WEEKLY PAY:</strong></p>
			<p>AmeriBanc is going to pay you EVERY SINGLE WEEK!!! For every <strong>APPROVAL</strong> you get in a calendar week, we are going to pay you the very next FRIDAY! You will receive <strong>4-5 PAYCHECKS DEPENDING ON THE MONTH!!!</strong></p>
			<br />
			<p><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">NEW COMMISSION PROGRAM + OFF BOARD BONUS</strong></p>
			
			<p>You can earn up to $675  for EVERY *QUALIFYING ACCOUNT APPROVED during that week based on the following:</p>
			<br />
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-281 aligncenter" title="Comm Table" src="/assets/img/portfolio/com-table.png" width="75%" class="img-responsive" /></p>
			<br />
			<p>Every self-generated or business card prospected merchant above that is installed will receive up top a $100 &#8220;OFF BOARD Bonus&#8221; paid as follows: $50 paid weekly on approved Off Board accounts. If you have 15 Approved accounts for the month then you will receive an additional $25 for each OFF Board approved account and $50 if 20 approved accounts for the month.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Application Fee received above will be paid the amount collected as follows. $50 paid weekly of the submitted application fees and an additional $25 at the end of the month if you have 15 Approved accounts or an extra $50 if 20 Approved accounts at month end for a total of 100% of the total collected and submitted application fees.</p>
			<br />
			<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Approved Account</strong></span> = Qualifying Accounts are retail/restaurant/wireless/MOTO (only if had a stand-alone MOTO before) service SIC&#8217;s that do not include multiple MIDs per terminal or multiple TID in same location. Straight Reprograms of existing equipment with NO Free Placement provided DO qualify for commission as long as they have full standard fee structure.</p>
			<br />
			<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Full Valued Account</strong></span> = Our standard hard coded fee structure listed on our Schedule of Fees. If you and or your Regional Manager feel that you need to make some adjustments to earn the account then you can adjust them but that will result in a $25 deduct or as much as a $50 deduct based on what all is changed to earn the customer.</p>
			<br />
			<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Application Fee Received</strong></span> = This is our standard $59 application fee. Anything lower needs to be approved by your Regional Manager and will result in a lower commission since you are compensated on all or part of what you collect. ($89 for Stand Alone ROAMpay Smart Phone accounts)</p>
			<br />
			<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Groovv Offers Value Added Service</strong></span> = Qualifying Accounts are retail/restaurant/wireless service SIC&#8217;s that do not include multiple MID&#8217;s per terminal or multiple TID in same location.</p>

			<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MONTHLY BONUS</span></strong>:<br />
			We have simplified the Monthly Bonus as well.</p>
			<p><center><a href="/assets/img/portfolio/monthlybonus.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-225" title="monthlyBonusTable 11-2-2012" src="/assets/img/portfolio/monthlybonus.png" width="60%" /></a></center><span style="text-decoration: underline;">

            <p><h4 style="text-decoration: underline;color:rgb(0,90,170)"><strong>RESIDUAL INCOME</h4></strong></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>AmeriBanc National receives residuals on all profitable accounts that process with our company on a monthly basis. You can earn residuals paid on a monthly basis based on the same number of installed deals like we have always had. 15 installs in a month will earn a 7% residual, 20 is 10%, 25 is 12%, 30 is 15%, 35 is 20%, 40 is 25%, 45 is 30% and 50 is 35% of the AmeriBanc Residuals. Residuals will be paid by the end of the following month. (Example&#8230; January will be posted on line and paid by the end of February)</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong><h4 style="text-decoration: underline;color:rgb(0,90,170)">CONTINUED RESIDUAL INCOME</h4></strong><br />
			For the true entrepreneurs that want ALL the residuals, we will HELP YOU GET THEM! For the Merchant Consultants that want to write accounts ON THEIR OWN and GET ALL THE RESIDUALS, you can still earn the same residual for 6 months AFTER YOU&#8217;VE GONE ON YOUR OWN! AmeriBanc provides this income potential to help bridge the income until your 50% Residuals start coming in STRONG!</p>
