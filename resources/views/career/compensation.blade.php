					<p>Let's be honest, you need to know how much money you can actually earn at this before you can make the kind of commitment that it takes to succeed. Within the Electronic Payments Industry, AmeriBanc is leading the way in compensation programs to allow the front line Merchant Consultants to focus on bringing in new customers on a daily basis. </p>

					<br />

                    <br />
                    <strong>FAST START BONUS<strong>
					
					<br />
					
					<p>To help kick start your new career with AmeriBanc National, we offer you a Fast Start Bonus. During the first 30 days (Starting with the first day after your training), we offer you a fast start bonus of an additional $100 on every approved deal when you sell just 20 or more merchants in that 30 day period. So if you sell 20 deals in that 30 days you would receive $2000. If you sell 36 you would receive $3600 fast start bonus. We have <strong>NO CAP</strong> on this bonus. All you have to do is sell 20 in your first 30 days and you will make an additional $100 for each merchant account for those and each account thereafter.</p>
					
					<br />
					
					<strong>COMMISSION PACKAGES<strong>

					<br>
					
					<p>Our average reps are earning between $45,000 and $65,000 yearly. Our better reps will earn $65,000 to $100,000 and our top reps will earn $100,000 to $150,000+. Every time you give a new system away and earn a new customer, you will increase your income. </p>

					<br>
					
					<p>We will provide you with 2-5 confirmed qualified appointments per day. All that you have to do is show them the benefits of our services and offer them a brand new next generation payment terminal FREE of charge to use so they can benefit from our services. The more that you place the more that you make. </p>

					<br>
					
					<p>We pay you "Every Week", so that you get immediate gratification. Each Free Terminal that you give away will be worth $100 - $675 depending on the value added services that you have presented and sold the merchant. Also if you self generate the sale, it is worth twice as much in base commission. </p>

					<br>
					
					<p>It is virtually unheard of to offer sales rep's in this industry free equipment to hand out to business owners but AMERIBANC is a very unusual company. We want to capture market share and we believe that with your help we can do just that. </p>

					<br>
					
					<p>AmeriBanc is able to create the most profitable relationship possible for Merchant Consultants in this industry because of our strong relationships within the industry that allow us to pass through the most aggressive compensation package ever! </p>

					<br>
					
					<p>This All-In-One Next Generation Payment System handles 100% of today's Merchant Processing Needs and meets anticipated needs for tomorrow. </p>

					<br>
					
					<strong>WEEKLY & MONTHLY BONUS</strong>
					
					<br>
					
					<p>Every Merchant Consultant with AmeriBanc can qualify for a weekly and/or a monthly bonus. This can be as much as $4,000+ per month which will go a long way to increase you income and more than cover any costs associated with placing those free terminals and earning the business owner as a customer. </p>

					<br>
					
					<strong>PAY PERIODS</strong>
					
					<br>
					
					<p>Every Merchant Consultant will be paid every week with an ACH deposited on Friday </p>
