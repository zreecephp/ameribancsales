                                                                                </section><!-- .heading-bordered end -->

                    <p>The Electronic Payments Industry has been evolving for about 35 years to become what it is today. As recently as 10-15 years ago, the product offering was relatively simple and easy to present to customers. The original offering was the simple ability to accept plastic credit cards electronically to help automate the process of receiving an authorization that the card was good and to initiate the depositing process of those funds from the customer's account to the business owner's account. The typical sales presentation keyed on one of two issues, the price of the terminal to read the cards and the price of the service fees to deliver the funds.</P> 
                                                <br />
                    <p>Today, the business offering has evolved dramatically. There are still many companies that approach the industry just as everyone did 15 years ago targeting new business openings as their main customers and reduce their offering to the cheapest equipment price and lowest apparent discount rate.</p>
            <br />            
                    <p>But new opportunities have presented themselves to the more sophisticated companies, and that is where AmeriBanc differs from the rest of the industry. To take advantage of these opportunities, AmeriBanc has adopted a "consultative" approach to both our end-user client merchants as well as our Merchant Consultant Staff. This approach gives our company and our sales staff a tremendous advantage over competitors. Coupled with a totally FREE Equipment offering, our Value-Based Presentation is truly “Next Generation”.</p> 
            <br />
