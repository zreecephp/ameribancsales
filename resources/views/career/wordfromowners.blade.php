                                                                                </section><!-- .heading-bordered end -->

                    <p><strong>A Word From Dan Lewis</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>CEO / Co-founder AmeriBanc National</strong></p>
            <br />        
                    <p>I began my career in the electronic payments industry about 30 years ago. </p>
            <br />        
                    <p>I have worked for hardware companies, check companies, software companies, processing companies and banks that have given me a broad perspective to help me understand this very dynamic marketplace. I have been very fortunate to have been involved in all aspects of this industry including selling point-of-sale equipment, marketing plastic cards and embossing machines, initiating time and attendance programs, and rolling out the newest gift card/smart card programs as well as various check service programs. I have also conducted numerous sales and marketing consulting workshops teaching successful practices and processes in this industry. </p>
            <br />        
                    <p>This is an exciting time in our industry, as we have something new to talk with our customers about. For example, the new electronic check programs that allow the merchant to stamp the consumers check at the point of sale. Then give it back to them while depositing it into the merchant's account electronically with out having to go to the bank. This is a big advantage for the merchants saving them time and money. Another new and exciting idea for merchants is the electronic gift card and loyalty programs. How many of you have purchased a gift card? Most of you would say "yes" and name some large retailer like "Best Buy, Sears, or a large restaurant chain". What about the local retailer down the block from where you live? They should have one as well, because now it will be FREE. WE HAVE DECIDED TO GIVE THEM A NEW NEXT GENERATION SYSTEM FREE OF CHARGE so that the business owners can try these services out. No one else has told them about these new services let alone offered them a free system to make them work. That is hopefully what you will be able to do very soon. </p>
            <br />        
                    <p>Remember this is an exciting time in an industry that, in my opinion, is recession proof. When was the last time you went to a business that was trying to sell you a good or service and they didn't take some form of payment. Probably never? That is precisely the service we facilitate. We offer every business many different forms of payment so they can choose what is best for them, and now if they don't have equipment to make it work we will provide them a new next generation system FREE of charge to help them take advantage of these services. We help them increase their revenues, lower their risks and liabilities and save them time and money. If we can do that then everyone "WINS". If we can't then we have at least educated them about business practices that could help them out in the future. </p>
            <br />        
                    <p>I hope to see you soon in our training class and on our sales leader board. </p>

                    <p><strong>A Word From Chris McIntire</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>President / Co-founder AmeriBanc National</strong></p>
            <br />            
                    <p>Welcome to the AmeriBanc website and to the Electronic Payments Industry! </p>
            <br />            
                    <p>Many amazing things are transforming the Electronic Payments Industry today, but nothing will be as big or have as large of an impact as our new next generation FREE terminal placement program! Every industry cycles and evolves in different ways and our industry has opened up tremendous opportunities for our company, our customers and most importantly, YOU as a potential representative for AmeriBanc. </p>
            <br />           
                    <p>Along with the CEO, Dan Lewis, I have experienced many facets of this industry over the last decade. I have worked in many capacities that keep me focused on the street-level attractiveness of our programs and services to our target market - Business Owners. </p>
            <br />            
                    <p>During my career I have worked as a front line sales representative for years as well as founding three different and profitable companies based on sound business fundamentals. Concepts like integrity, hard work and creating an enjoyable and profitable program for the in-house staff and the consultant staff have paid off huge dividends. </p>
            <br />            
                    <p>In this Industry sales people have always been paid as an independent contractor which offers you the opportunity to have no caps on your income and to get paid for how good you are personally. To keep things relatively short and to the point, I just want to emphasize that many people will tell you that your success is up to you alone, which to a great extent, I will agree. However; no matter how hard you work, you will fail if you don't align yourselves with the right business partners and programs that work as hard for you as you do for them. I have learned this lesson personally a few times and witnessed it numerous others.</p> 
            <br />            
                    <p>AmeriBanc has some core commitments within our business philosophy that emphasize simply doing the right thing on a daily basis. This is not always as easy as it sounds and does not always mesh with the popular business wisdom of the day, but it allows us as the directors and owners of AmeriBanc to feel good about our successes and facilitate yours in the process. Our new FREE TERMINAL PLACEMENT PROGRAM and our ADVANCEMENT PROGRAM shows our commitment to you that will allow you to grow with our company. There are very few true Win-Win situations in life, but AmeriBanc is committed to that concept. We know that we cannot succeed unless you succeed first.</p>
                                                <br />                   
                                                                </div><!-- .triggerAnimation.animated end -->
